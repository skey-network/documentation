# Skey Keeper

A tool to manage your private keys securely.

Skey Keeper is a crypto wallet extension that enables users to interact with applications operating within the Skey Network ecosystem.\
It can store Skey technical tokens (called SkeyUSD) necessary to perform transactions on the Skey Network Blockchain.

Skey Keeper allows users to generate SEED phrases and accounts that can be used with apps like the Key Manager, Skey bridge, and so on.

The Skey Keeper allows users to sign transactions with just a couple of clicks. Every user can create multiple wallets and switch between them on a whim. If you forget the password to the account, you can recover it from your SEED, as with any other crypto wallet.
