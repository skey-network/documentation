# Introduction

Skey Keeper allows you to hold your Skey keys securely while interacting safely with third-party web resources. This is a kind of Simple Authentication and SSO for dApps or Skey-enabled web applications that allows you to sign transactions without entering your private key or password.

Seed phrases and private keys are encrypted and stored within the extension and cannot be accessed by the dApps and services on the web, giving you peace of mind that your funds are always safe from hackers and malicious sites. Completing a transaction doesnâ€™t require entering any sensitive information.

Skey Keeper is designed for convenience, so you can sign transactions with just a couple of clicks. You can create multiple wallets and switch between them easily, and if you ever forget the password to the account you can recover it from your seed phrase, as normal. With Skey Keeper, you can always be sure that you are in the right place and confirm outgoing transactions from your Skey account.
