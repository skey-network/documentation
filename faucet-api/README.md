# Faucet API

An API designed for users interacting with SmartKey. It allows you to send small amounts of funds without authentication. The API documentation is available at the root path e.g. [https://faucet.skey.network/ ](https://faucet.skey.network/) (or [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) if you're developing locally).

We can distinguish between four types of a request methods:

* refill address to max amount
* refill address to max amount with captcha
* refill address to max amount only if it has authorized tokens
* refill address to max amount with API key.

The tool is available at [https://faucet.skey.network/](https://faucet.skey.network/)
