# The Skey Network Ecosystem access

![Skey Network Infrastructure](<.gitbook/assets/Skey Network Infrastructure\_2.png>)

The diagram above shows how the Skey Network Ecosystem works with multiple Suppliers. The applications are connected to each other through the blockchain. Suppliers have their own decentralised application - dApp - within this blockchain network. The dApp is managed using the Supplier API; optionally, this can be done using the control panel for the Supplier API - i.e. the Key Manager. If a Supplier wants to be fully integrated, it will need to deploy a Listener in its infrastructure to allow it to execute actions on its own devices from other Suppliers' applications. The overall solution forms Oracle's Skey Network Ecosystem.

Each provider may optionally use a publicly accessible server - Data Service - in its ICT infrastructure. This enables faster reading of information from blockchain.

In order to connect to Skey Network's technical blockchain, each Partner is recognised as a "provider" of a new service, who implements elements of Skey Network's architecture, such as:

* REST API as an interface to manage the Supplier's main dApp;
* Listener, which listens for events from the Supplier dApp and at the appropriate moment sends a signal to the IoT cloud with the relevant command;
* Elements that make up the rest of the Oracle ecosystem, such as Supplier API, or Key Manager.

After connection to the Oracle ecosystem, partners can communicate and transfer data across the blockchain network.

The tangential element between providers is blockchain and the device's keys (tokens) NFT generated therein.

For proper functionality, each element is described with procedures to enable easy and intuitive integration of the Partner into the Skey Network ecosystem platform. Among the main procedures are, among others, the following processes:

* creation of a user account, namely a wallet, from the level of a dedicated application;
* adding an IoT device;
* generating and transmitting the Skey Network's key to the user application;

Additionally, the Supplier API's key may have properties/information necessary for the service provider, such as:

* the time during which the contract is valid. For example, access to a hotel room may be active from 16:00 until 10:00 the next morning;
* the date of expiry of the contract. For example, a car may be available for 24 hours;
* payment and method of payment.



The Skey Network standard can be used by the company to manage access to both assets and services - e.g. providing employees access to the company's office, as well as by individuals for their own needs - e.g. locking and unlocking the house or providing access to the flat for law enforcement services.
