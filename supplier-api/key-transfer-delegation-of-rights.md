# Key transfer ( delegation of rights)

Transferring the key is equivalent to transferring the rights to the device. Only the User/Supplier who has it in their wallet can transfer it.

The transfer can be performed from the mobile application or from the Supplier API using the endpoint PUT /keys/{assetId}/transfer/{address}, where assetId is the blockchain identifier of the key and address is the address to which the **** key is transferred. The address of the Supplier API procedure is as follows:
