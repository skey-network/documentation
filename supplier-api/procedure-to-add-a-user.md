# Procedure to add a user

The procedure to add a new user to the Skey Network Ecosystem is done through the Supplier API using the POST /users endpoint. An example of this procedure can be found at this address:

The whole procedure consists of generating the address and recording information about it in the Supplier dApp. At the same time, a request is made for the transfer of funds for execution fees.
