# Supplier API

Supplier API is one of the Skey Network's components that allows to manage the Supplierâ€™s dApp. It allows for example, to:

* creating new accounts for devices in the blockchain, known as wallets;
* moderation of devices' metadata such as name, description, geolocation;
* devices' key management ( creating, transferring, blocking, assigning expiry time).

Documentation, usage examples and error codes can be found at [https://demo.supplier-api.SkeyNetworkplatform.com/api\_docs/](https://demo.supplier-api.smartkeyplatform.com/api\_docs/) . The analysis should start with the tools, in particular /utils/setup.
