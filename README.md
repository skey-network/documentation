## **Introduction**

Skey Network's vision is to lay the foundations for the smart cities of the future. In order to do that, we are developing a range of products, partnerships, and technical solutions. These products use the universal BoT (Blockchain of Things) system to connect devices, technologies, systems, and clouds to blockchain platforms.

The Skey Network project is largely focused on automatization of the billing process and access to services. All operations, beginning with reservations and ending with access to facilities, are mostly implemented using simple systems such as sensors or electronic locks. They can be easily connected to the Skey Network Ecosystem, which in this case acts as a communication bus for IoT clouds of different suppliers. These devices are becoming increasingly common in the world that surrounds us. Skey Network is focused on devices that give access to resources such as gates, cars, car parks, parcel lockers, flats, buildings in terms of widely understood access control. However, there are many more uses and they can only be limited by our creativity.

Skey Networkâ€™s products are more than just an application for each of our partners. Our solutions are a universal base on which our partners and later other companies or individuals can build their own applications using the products available through the Skey Network Ecosystem. This allows for a wider implementation of SmartKey in various business models building a global marketplace of services, including access control.

Skey Network will provide the universal platform on which partners, companies, and individuals can build their own applications. This will allow for wide implementation of Skey Network in various business models. By building bridges between the on-chain and off-chain world, we allow blockchain and smart contracts to access off-chain assets, making them far more powerful and interoperable.
