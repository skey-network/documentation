# dApp

Skey Network allows users to create and manage dApps. DApps(shorthand for “decentralised applications”) are scripts uploaded to a blockchain account allowing other accounts to perform actions on the dApp with invokable functions defined in the script.&#x20;

Skey Network has created multiple dApps to ease the process of implementing blockchain capacities to your IoT devices.

The dApps are as follows:

* [dApp Father](dappfather/)
* [Supplier](supplier/)
* [Device](device/)
* [Organisation](organisation/)
