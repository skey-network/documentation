# Organisation

As part of the popularisation of the Skey Network application, the blockchain account has been extended with features (dApp) to extend its usability. dApps in the SmartKey ecosystem are accounts not only for Suppliers but also for Organisations.

The Organisation account allows multiple users to use keys that are contained in that account. Access to the keys is secured through an ACL. A user can add themselves to the ACL by calling a method in the Organisation dApp attaching an activation token in the transaction.

An ACL (Access Control List) is a whitelist of wallet addresses that have access to Organisation keys.

The dAppFather in this case represents an account on the blockchain storing a list of all the Organisation audited and described decentralised applications.

`Activation tokens` - these are licence tokens generated by the Organisation, giving you the ability to add your account to the Organisation's ACL. They are generated by the Organisation in any quantity and then distributed to end usersâ€™ wallets.
